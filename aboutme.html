    <h1>about me</h1>
    <p>i am working toward getting a job and be successful in my personal and professional life, no experiences led me here. I just want to work so i can start making my own money to pay for stuff. and so i can eventually have enough for bigger things when I'm older. waiting until i find the right job for me, and then i will apply for it. and i am searching online and in person for a job i think i will like.  honesty, and considerate , these are the two most important values in my opinion because no one really likes liars do they, and also people like others that put themselves first instead of being greedy all the time, i think u need both of those if u want to succeed. i hope to be a general manager or a ceo, of my own company, have a semi luxury life. maybe own a couple businesses outside of the state im in, for examples restaurants, dealerships , yacht clubs things like that. and then giving money to charity is another goal i have. integrity because, i wanna show the world that they can trust what i have to say. and considerate so people know i am not a greedy person. and achievements i wanna be known for is putting homeless people into houses. paying alot for big charities, and also feed people in need.</p>
